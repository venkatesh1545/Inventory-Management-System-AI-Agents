## 🧩 What Problem Are We Solving?

**Today’s Hiring = Time-consuming, biased, inefficient.**

Companies waste time filtering 1000s of resumes, managing interviews, and onboarding — yet still end up with poor fits. The recruitment tech space is still **manual, keyword-based, and fragmented.**

- End-to-end recruitment powered by **AI agents** that:
  - Understand human context
  - Personalize communication
  - Improve over time with feedback
